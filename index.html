    <p>Happy 19th birthday! 
<br><br>
You have been strong and brave this past dayss, and I want you to keep it up and don't give up because I'm here ready to listen whenever you have a problem. I may not always be by your side, but I promise you are always in my heart.
<br><br>
I think it's almost 1 year from the day you gave me my core memory of my life, yun nag confess ako sayo. Will be always gratefull to you. Thank you for being that person
<br><br>
Lastly I wish you to achieve your goals with or without me and be positive always.
